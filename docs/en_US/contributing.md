# Contribution Guide

Welcome to the official LSSM Contribution Guide!

:::tip Do you need help?
Of course, you can ask for support via one of the ways mentioned in [Support](./support.md).

Especially, on our <discord/> are many volunteer translators who love to help newcomers too.
:::

If you're new to contributing to LSSM, please read [Introduction][introduction], [Commit a File][commit] and [Creating a Pull Request][pr] first!

## General workflow

1. Create or update your fork
2. Change a file with the help of our guides:
   * [Translations](./contributing/translations.md)
3. Commit the updated file
   * please read [Commit a File][commit] first
4. When ready, create a Pull Request (PR) with the help of [Creating a Pull Request][pr]
   * If you plan to update multiple files, such as a whole module or even more, please **do not** create the PR after the first file but as soon as you want your updates to get live for beta-testers
